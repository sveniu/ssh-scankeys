ssh-scankeys - Scan for OpenSSH authorized and private keys

The scan-authkeys script will derive the list of authorized key file patterns
from sshd's own configuration and expand any username and homedir tokens to
obtain the full path to all authorized key files. It then scans all files and
prints a formatted output consisting of username; file owner, group, mode and
mtime; pubkey fingerprint, bit length and type; file path, and finally the
full pubkey with any options and comments.

The scan-privkeys script will by default scan all home directories for files
matching id_* (but not *.pub), and then extract the public key if possible. It
prints a formatted output for each key consisting of file owner, group, mode
and mtime; pubkey fingerprint, bit length, type and encryption status; file
path; full pubkey with any options and comments. Alternatively, scan-privkeys
can scan all file systems for files with a size range that could contain
private keys.
